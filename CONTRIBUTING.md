## 🎯 Project Overview

### What is Stellance?

Stellance is a **decentralized freelance payment platform** that eliminates traditional payment barriers for freelancers worldwide. Instead of using PayPal, Upwork, or banks (which charge high fees and exclude many users), we use the **Stellar blockchain** for instant, low-cost, cross-border payments.

### The Problem We're Solving

- **High Fees:** Platforms like Upwork take 20% of earnings
- **Banking Barriers:** Millions of freelancers can't receive international payments
- **Slow Payouts:** Traditional payments take 3-7 days
- **Lack of Trust:** No transparent escrow system

### Our Solution

- ✅ **Instant payments** (3-5 seconds on Stellar)
- ✅ **Low fees** (<2% platform fee + $0.0001 network fee)
- ✅ **No bank required** (just a Stellar wallet)
- ✅ **Trustless escrow** (smart contract holds funds until work is approved)
- ✅ **Global access** (works anywhere Stellar is accessible)

## 👥 User Flows

### Flow 1: Client Posts a Job & Hires Freelancer

```
1. Client signs up → creates Stellar wallet (or connects existing)
2. Client posts a job (title, description, budget)
3. Freelancers browse jobs and apply
4. Client reviews applications and hires a freelancer
5. System creates a Contract
6. Client funds escrow (sends XLM/USDC to escrow account)
   └─► Escrow smart contract locks funds
7. Contract status → "active"
```

### Flow 2: Freelancer Completes Work & Gets Paid

```
1. Freelancer works on the job
2. Freelancer submits work for review
3. Client reviews and approves work
4. System calls escrow contract to release funds
   └─► Stellar blockchain transfers XLM/USDC to freelancer's wallet
5. Payment record created (links to Stellar tx hash)
6. Contract status → "completed"
```

### Flow 3: Dispute Resolution

```
1. Either party opens a dispute
2. Contract status → "disputed"
3. Escrow funds are frozen
4. Platform admin reviews evidence
5. Admin decides:
   a) Release to freelancer
   b) Refund to client
   c) Split payment
6. Escrow contract executes decision
```

## 🔌 API Design

### Authentication

All protected endpoints require a JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Endpoint Patterns

```
POST   /auth/register          - Create new user
POST   /auth/login             - Get JWT token
GET    /auth/me                - Get current user

GET    /users/:id              - Get user profile
PATCH  /users/:id              - Update profile

PATCH  /jobs/:id               - Update job (owner only)
DELETE /jobs/:id               - Delete job (owner only)
POST   /jobs/:id/apply         - Apply to job (freelancer only)

POST   /contracts              - Create contract (when hiring)
GET    /contracts              - List user's contracts
GET    /contracts/:id          - Get contract details
PATCH  /contracts/:id/submit   - Submit work (freelancer)
PATCH  /contracts/:id/approve  - Approve & release funds (client)
PATCH  /contracts/:id/dispute  - Open dispute

GET    /payments               - List payments
GET    /payments/:id           - Get payment details

POST   /escrow/fund            - Client funds escrow
POST   /escrow/release         - Release funds to freelancer
POST   /escrow/refund          - Refund to client
```

### Response Format

All responses follow this structure:

```typescript
// Success
{
  success: true,
  data: { ... }
}

// Error
{
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
    message: "Invalid credentials"
  }
}
```

## ⛓️ Stellar Integration

### Why Stellar?

- **Fast:** 3-5 second settlement
- **Cheap:** $0.0001 per transaction
- **Built for payments:** Native multi-currency support
- **Soroban:** Smart contracts for escrow logic

### How We Use Stellar

#### 1. User Wallets

Each user has a Stellar wallet (public/private keypair):
- **Public Key:** Stored in database, used to receive payments
- **Private Key:** User controls (via Freighter browser extension)

#### 2. Escrow Account

The platform maintains an escrow account:
- Clients send funds to this account when hiring
- Smart contract controls when funds can be released
- Only released when both parties agree (or admin resolves dispute)

#### 3. Payment Flow

```
Client Wallet
     │
     │ (1) Send XLM/USDC to escrow
     ▼
Escrow Account (Smart Contract)
     │
     │ (2) Client approves work
     ▼
Freelancer Wallet
```

### Soroban Smart Contract (Escrow)

```rust
// Simplified contract structure
pub struct EscrowContract;

impl EscrowContract {
    // Lock funds when contract is created
    pub fn create_escrow(
        contract_id: String,
        client: Address,
        freelancer: Address,
        amount: i128,
    ) -> Result<(), Error>
    
    // Release funds to freelancer
    pub fn release_escrow(
        contract_id: String,
        caller: Address,  // Must be client or admin
    ) -> Result<(), Error>
    
    // Refund to client
    pub fn refund_escrow(
        contract_id: String,
        caller: Address,  // Must be both parties or admin
    ) -> Result<(), Error>
}
```

### Stellar SDK Usage (Backend)

```typescript
// Example: Creating an escrow payment
import * as StellarSDK from '@stellar/stellar-sdk';

async fundEscrow(contractId: string, amount: number) {
  const server = new StellarSDK.Horizon.Server('https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org');
  
  // Build transaction
  const transaction = new StellarSDK.TransactionBuilder(escrowAccount)
    .addOperation(
      StellarSDK.Operation.payment({
        destination: freelancerPublicKey,
        asset: StellarSDK.Asset.native(), // XLM
        amount: amount.toString(),
      })
    )
    .build();
  
  // Sign and submit
  transaction.sign(escrowKeypair);
  const result = await server.submitTransaction(transaction);
  
  return result.hash; // Store this in the database
}
```
